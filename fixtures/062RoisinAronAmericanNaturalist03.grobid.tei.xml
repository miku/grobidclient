<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In social Hymenoptera, relatedness asymmetries due to haplodiploidy often generate conflicts of genetic interest between queens and workers. Split sex ratios are common in ant populations and may result from such conflicts, with workers favoring the production of males in some colonies and of gynes in others. Such intercolonial differences may result from variations in relatedness asymmetries among colony members, but several examples are now known in which this hypothesis does not hold. We develop here a simple model assuming monogynous, monoandrous, worker-sterile, perennial colonies without dispersal restrictions. Workers may eliminate eggs of either sex and determine the caste of the female brood, but the queen controls the number of eggs of each sex she lays. In such conditions, we demonstrate that split sex ratios can result from queens adopting a mixed evolutionary stable strategy (ESS), with one option being to put a strict limit to the number of diploid eggs available and the alternative one to provide diploid eggs ad lib. In the former situation, workers should raise all diploid eggs as workers and release only male sexuals. In the latter, workers should adjust the caste ratio so as to reach the maximum sexual productivity for the colony, which is entirely invested into gynes. For a particular relative investment in gynes at the population level, between 0.5 (ESS under full queen control) and 0.75 (ESS under full worker control), an equilibrium is reached at which both strategies yield an equal genetic payoff to the queen. Male-specialized colonies are predicted to be equally abundant but less populous and less productive than gyne-specialized ones.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Over the past decades, the study of sex ratio in eusocial Hymenoptera (ants, bees, wasps) has provided some of the best quantitative evidence for the importance of kin selection and inclusive fitness theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hamilton 1964;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bourke and Franks 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Crozier and Pamilo 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chapuisat and Keller 1999)</ref>. This is largely due to the haplodiploid sex determination system, which results in queens being equally related to their sons and daughters, whereas workers are more closely related to their sisters than to their brothers. These asymmetrical values of relatedness may generate a conflict of genetic interest between the queen and her workers over sex allocation. For instance, in a monogynous, monoandrous, and worker-sterile colony, workers are three times more closely related to their sisters than to their brothers. They may therefore maximize their inclusive fitness by favoring a female-biased sex investment ratio. By contrast, the queen is symmetrically related to both sexes of her progeny and is selected to favor an equal investment in males and gynes. A critical issue concerning the sex ratio of reproductive offspring in eusocial Hymenoptera is therefore to what extent each caste manages to control the allocation of resources into dispersers of either sex. Haplodiploidy allows queens to control the primary sex ratio (i.e., the relative abundance of male and female embryos) by fertilizing or not fertilizing the eggs they lay. However, because workers rear the brood, they can potentially control the secondary sex ratio (i.e., the relative abundance of males and gynes among sexuals) by selective elimination of male larvae <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aron et al. 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aron et al. , 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aron et al. , 1999;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Passera and Aron 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Sundstro ¨m et al. 1996)</ref> or by altering the proportion of female larvae developing into workers or gynes <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hammond et al. 2002)</ref>. Thus, as formulated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Trivers and Hare (1976)</ref>, when all colony members are the offspring of a single once-mated queen and in the absence of dispersal restrictions, the population-wide sex allocation is predicted to be 3 : 1 in favor of gynes under full worker control and to stabilize near 1 : 1 under full queen control. Under mixed control, intermediate sex allocation ratios are predicted. In such a case, workers should attempt to favor the production of gynes, whereas the queen should favor males.</p><p>Whether conflicts over sex allocation imply conflicts over resource allocation between castes (reproductives vs. workers) has been a controversial issue <ref type="bibr">(Pamilo 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bourke and Chan 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Herbers et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Reuter and Keller 2001)</ref>. A crucial point is the relationship between the present sex allocation pattern and that expected in the future. In annual colonies, with an explosive strategy, the condition is trivial: there is no cost for the queen in limiting the number of diploid eggs laid toward the end of the colony's life because no workers are needed for the future. The queen can therefore impose an upper limit to the amount of gynes that can be raised, thereby forcing workers to invest the surplus of resources into males. However, a conflict may arise in perennial colonies because diploid eggs are needed to maintain a worker population, but workers could choose to direct them to gynes rather than to new workers.</p><p>Colony sex ratios have been analyzed across a broad range of eusocial Hymenoptera. In many instances, most colonies in a population produce almost exclusively dispersers of a single sex <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bourke and Franks 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Crozier and Pamilo 1996)</ref>. To explain such patterns, the relatedness asymmetry hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Boomsma and</ref><ref type="bibr">Grafen 1990, 1991)</ref> assumes that colony kin structure and therefore relatedness asymmetry (i.e., the relative value of gyne-worker and male-worker relatedness) may vary between colonies within populations. The theory predicts that if workers are in control of sex allocation and can assess relatedness asymmetry in their own colony, they should favor gynes wherever the relatedness asymmetry is higher than the population average and males wherever it is lower <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Boomsma and</ref><ref type="bibr">Grafen 1990, 1991)</ref>. A strong point of this theory is that it unequivocally predicts strongly bimodal or split sex ratios. It has received ample support from ants, bees, and wasps (reviews in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Queller and Strassmann 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chapuisat and Keller 1999)</ref>.</p><p>However, in several ant species, workers do not bias colony sex ratios as predicted by the relatedness asymmetry theory. This suggests either that queens are in control of the sex ratio or that factors other than relatedness asymmetry are predominant. For instance, split sex ratios occur in the monogyne form of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta, which is monoandrous and worker sterile and is therefore not expected to display intercolonial differences in relatedness asymmetry <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fletcher and Ross 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Ross and Fletcher 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Ross 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Vargo 1996)</ref>. In Pheidole pallidula, sex ratio specialization is not associated with relatedness asymmetry but with the number of queens and probably with the level of available resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aron et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fournier et al. 2003</ref>). In the polygyne form of Formica exsecta, the need for replacement queens seems to be the main factor favoring gyne-biased sex ratios independently of relatedness asymmetry <ref type="bibr">(Brown and</ref><ref type="bibr">Keller 2000, 2002)</ref>. Another possible explanation is that the controlling party itself differs among colonies <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bourke and Franks 1995)</ref>: for instance, if the queen controls sex allocation in small colonies whereas workers control it in large colonies, the former should specialize in males and the latter in gynes. A positive association between colony size and relative investment in gynes has been reported in several ant species (review in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Crozier and Pamilo 1996)</ref>, but whether this is due to the queen's ability to control sex allocation in smaller colonies is hard to demonstrate. In particular, the queen's ability to direct the development of the female castes in her own interest is often questionable <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Keller and Nonacs 1993)</ref>. Other hypotheses have been put forward, such as the constant male hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Frank 1987</ref>) and multifaceted parental investment <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Rosenheim et al. 1996)</ref>, but neither of them satisfactorily accounts for extreme sex ratio specialization.</p><p>The first experimental evidence for queen control on sex allocation in ants recently came from the monogyne form of the fire ant S. invicta, in which the relative amount of haploid eggs laid by the queen determines whether the colony will be male or gyne specialized <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aron et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Passera et al. 2001)</ref>. The queen thus exerts some control over colony sex allocation, although actual sex investment ratios are female biased at the population level, suggesting some extent of worker control as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aron et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Vargo 1996</ref>). It has long been suggested that the queen may attempt to manipulate the sex allocation ratio by limiting the amount of diploid eggs available, thereby forcing workers to raise males: according to the theoretical approaches of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bulmer (1981)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bulmer and Taylor (1981)</ref>, this strategy could allow the queen to achieve a substantial degree of control over sex allocation, especially if the relative cost of a gyne is low compared with that of a worker. This hypothesis was recently revived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Reuter and Keller (2001)</ref>. However, none of these models predicted the occurrence of split sex ratios. In this article, we reexamine the hypothesis of diploid egg limitation on slightly different bases. We show with the help of a very simple model that under basic assumptions, split sex ratios can evolve as a mixed evolutionary stable strategy (ESS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Maynard Smith 1982)</ref> from the queens' point of view.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Model</head><p>We consider the most straightforward case of a population of monogynous, monoandrous, and worker-sterile hymenopteran colonies, which release dispersing males and gynes. Local mate competition <ref type="bibr">(Hamilton 1967)</ref>, local resource competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Clark 1978)</ref>, and inbreeding are assumed not to occur. The overall colony's productivity is a function of the resources brought in by the workers. We consider that these resources depend solely on the colony's worker force (w), which comes to assume that all colonies live in a similar, equally favorable environment. Colony productivity is deemed to increase with w at the be-p(w) ginning, but because additional workers yield a decreasing return as w rises, this function levels off.</p><p>We suppose that colonies are perennial and that their constituting individuals will adjust their pattern of resource investment so as to maximize their genetic payoff over a potentially infinite series of similar reproductive cycles. That is, we do not consider colonies in an ergonomic phase of growth, nor do we consider colonies displaying an explosive production of winged sexuals after which they would collapse. Instead, colonies are in a stable phase of maturity during which they maintain their worker population under a constant renewal rate while investing the surplus of production into sexuals. Therefore, the following equation describes the distribution of the colony's total productivity at each reproductive cycle:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p(w) p c w ϩ c f ϩ c m, w f m</formula><p>where , , and are the costs of production of a worker, c c c w f m of a gyne, and of a male, respectively, and w, f, and m are the number of workers replaced and the number of gynes and males released. The costs of production are assumed to be equal for all individuals of a caste. The colony's total sexual productivity is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">s(w) p c f ϩ c m p p(w) Ϫ c w. f m w</formula><p>It is necessary for our model to split the investment values for each caste between their constituents, that is, the number of individuals and their cost of production. This will allow us to express the workers' and queen's genetic payoffs as functions of the number of individuals of each sex raised by the colony (f and m). We will also distinguish between the numerical proportion of gynes among sexuals in the whole population (F) and the proportional investment in gynes relative to the total investment in sexuals (X; as in Pamilo 1991). Thus, for F gynes, there are 1 Ϫ males, and for an investment of in gynes, the in-</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">F c F f vestment in males equals . Therefore, c (1 Ϫ F) m c F f X p . c F ϩ c (1 Ϫ F) f m</formula><p>The population of colonies is allegedly large so that sex allocation decisions taken in a single focal colony do not immediately affect sex allocation at the population level.</p><p>According to classical sex allocation theory (eq. [4] of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bulmer and Taylor 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr">eq. [5.7]</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Crozier and Pamilo 1996)</ref>, the workers' and queen's genetic payoffs are proportional to, respectively,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">0.75f 0.25m V p ϩ , w F 1 Ϫ F 0.5f 0.5m V p ϩ . Q F 1 Ϫ F</formula><p>These functions describe the genetic payoffs obtained during one reproductive cycle, but because the colony is allegedly in a phase of stability, equal payoffs can be expected for each of the following cycles. Maximizing these functions thus also maximizes the lifetime genetic payoffs. The extent of control each caste (queen or workers) exerts on the amount of sexuals of each sex raised in the colony is of paramount importance. Here, both castes are given extensive freedom: the queen is in control of the absolute quantities of haploid (male) and diploid (female) eggs she lays, whereas workers are given full control of the number of eggs of each sex that are raised to maturity as well as of the caste identity (gynes or workers) of the diploid individuals. We assume that the population-wide sex allocation is comprised between 1 : 1 and 3 : 1 female biased (</p><p>). Within these limits, queen-worker 0.5 ! X ! 0.75 conflict over sex allocation is expected: the queen may attempt to limit the number of diploid eggs in order to favor the production of males, whereas workers may both eliminate haploid eggs (or male larvae) and direct as many diploid larvae as they wish toward either female caste as long as resources are sufficient. If the population-wide sex allocation lies outside of these limits, the queen and workers should agree to raise the less frequent sex, thereby returning the population-wide figures toward this conflict window.</p><p>Let N be the number of diploid eggs laid by the queen. Since there is no point for the queen to limit the number of haploid eggs, we suppose that such eggs are available ad lib. Let us now examine how the payoff functions vary according to N. Our notation is summarized in table 1.</p><p>As long as N is small, the amount of diploid eggs will be a limiting factor. A fraction of these diploid eggs will necessarily be raised as workers to perpetuate the colony. Because gynes constitute a better investment than males from the workers' viewpoint, the workers should then as- sign the remaining resources by priority to the remaining diploid brood to raise gynes. Any surplus of resources will then be invested into males. For a given value of N, we thus have</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">f p N Ϫ w, p(w) Ϫ c (N Ϫ w) Ϫ c w f w m p , c m 0.75(N Ϫ w) 0.25[p(w) ϩ (c Ϫ c )w Ϫ c N] f w f V p ϩ . w F c(1 Ϫ F) m (1)</formula><p>Let us call the maximum of function ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>), calculated * w by derivation: means that the population-wide investment in gynes is 0 less than three times the population-wide investment in males, which is the necessary condition for workers to favor gynes over males.

It should also be noted that w represents the number of workers replaced during one (annual) reproductive cycle, not the actual number present in the colony. If the average worker longevity is about 4 mo <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Calabi and Porter 1989)</ref>, worker turnover per annual reproductive cycle should therefore be three times the actual colony population.</p><p>In most social insects, constraints on foraging efficiency reduce the productivity per individual worker as colony size increases past the incipient stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Oster and Wilson 1978)</ref>. Various productivity functions satisfying this p(w) requirement can be considered. We tested several classes of curves, which yielded qualitatively similar results. For the present simulation, we selected the function proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bulmer and Taylor (1981)</ref> because it allows direct comparisons with their work, it features two constants of straightforward biological significance, and it is reasonably easy to manipulate analytically: </p><formula xml:id="formula_22">Ϫmw p(w) p K 1 Ϫ exp , [<label>( ) ]</label></formula></div>

As w increases, colony productivity approaches K.

In the basic simulation, we will therefore adopt , which might be a m p 10 plausible estimate of the average growth rate of a young S. invicta colony <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Tschinkel 1993</ref>) and will facilitate comparisons with <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bulmer and Taylor's (1981)</ref> results.

Adopting the male-forcing strategy thus becomes advantageous for the queen. Conversely, for , the male-forcing strategy becomes X ! 0.6911 more costly. Note that as X increases, the genetic payoff of the gyne-producing strategy decreases slowly because the reproductive success of gynes decreases while their total production remains constant (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>). Meanwhile, the payoff of the egg limitation strategy increases rapidly because the reproductive success of males increases, but the production of males increases as well since , the number * w of diploid eggs above which workers should start producing gynes at the expense of males, also rises.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Our model fits the simplest colony structure for a perennial social Hymenoptera: monogyny, monoandry, worker sterility, and absence of dispersal restrictions. It shows that split sex ratios can evolve without differences in genetic structure across colonies as a mixed ESS from the queens' perspective. This model rests on two extremely simple assumptions. First, it requires the queen to be in control of the number of diploid (and haploid) eggs she lays. This could allow her to influence the sex allocation in her favor by limiting the number of diploid eggs. Second, workers can eliminate as many male (and female) eggs and larvae as they wish and determine into which caste (worker or gyne) female larvae will develop. In short, workers are allowed to do what is best for themselves with the eggs provided by the queen. On the basis of these assumptions, our model shows that as workers manipulate sex allocation toward their own genetic interest, the queen's payoff function presents two maxima: one corresponding to a strict limitation of the diploid eggs laid and the other to their unlimited supply. Which of these maxima is higher de-  pends on the population-wide sex allocation ratio. Frequency-dependent selection should drive the population of queens toward an equilibrium at which egg-limited (male-producing) and non-egg-limited (gyne-producing) colonies are present in equal numbers. Because male-producing colonies are smaller and can invest less into sexuals than gyne-producing colonies, the overall sex allocation ratio is female biased.</p><p>The basic conditions of this model are similar to those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bulmer and Taylor (1981)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Reuter and Keller (2001)</ref> also modeled the possibility for the queen to limit the number of diploid eggs but with different assumptions. Why did the models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bulmer and Taylor (1981)</ref> and of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Reuter and Keller (2001)</ref> not predict split sex ratios? <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bulmer and Taylor (1981)</ref> did not treat the model analytically but realized a computer simulation, starting by fixing an arbitrary set of worker and queen strategies for an unlikely colony age (1,000 yr) and proceeding backwards. They supposed that the colony had only a limited probability (0.8) of surviving from one season to the next. For each year, they determined the set of strategies maximizing the queen's payoff, assuming that the workers would also maximize theirs. By repeating the operation until the values of N, f, m, and w stabilized, they obtained the equilibrium sex allocation ratio for the modeled colony. This equilibrium sex allocation ratio at the colony level j depended on the population sex allocation ratio s (Bulmer and Taylor designated as j and s the fraction of the reproductive investment devoted to males, so that their s is equal to according to our notation). When the colony's equi-1 Ϫ X librium j coincided with s, they assumed the population ESS had been reached. The ESS sex allocation was almost unbiased if gynes and workers had equal costs but became more female biased as the cost of a gyne increased relative to that of a worker. This tendency was the same as that observed in this study (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>), although the absolute values differed. What are the sources of discrepancies between their model and ours? Although <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bulmer and Taylor (1981)</ref> did not provide details as to the procedure followed to calculate the strategies maximizing the workers' and the queen's payoffs, it is clear that they did not allow for the possible existence of two genetic payoff maxima for the queen: the modeled colony was constrained to reach a stable sex allocation ratio, obeying , and 0.25 ≤ j ≤ 0.5 deemed to represent the ESS if this ratio was equal to that of the population. Their equilibrium values appear unlikely according to our model. For instance, for an equal cost of gynes and workers (</p><p>), Bulmer and Taylor c p c f w (1981) obtained the equilibrium for (or s p 0.499 X p ). With such a value, our model unequivocally pre-0.501 dicts that a queen laying diploid eggs ad lib. should invade. This can easily be understood intuitively: since there is almost no cost to the queen if workers raise gynes instead of males, the queen should just let the workers reach the maximum colony productivity and not restrain the number of diploid eggs to force the production of males.</p><p>A possible limitation of the present model is that it applies to perennial colonies that allegedly go through an infinite series of identical cycles, during which their worker population is kept stable by the replacement of dead or lost individuals, and that a steady flow of dispersing propagules (males and/or gynes) are released. Therefore, the optimal strategy for all parties is to reach the highest genetic payoff that can be repeated at each reproductive episode. Intuitively, this situation is the one that gives the least power of control to the queen because there is a high pressure for perpetuating the colony and thus a constant need of diploid eggs. At the opposite extreme, colonies with a single, terminal phase of sexual production should be totally under queen control. The next-to-trivial case of a bigenerational colony, in which resources of the first generation may be invested in all castes whereas secondgeneration resources are all invested into sexuals, also favors the queen <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bulmer 1981</ref>), but we are now extending this model to determine the range of conditions under which two types of colonies (egg limited, male producing vs. non-egg limited, gyne producing) are expected.</p><p>The model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Reuter and Keller (2001)</ref> suggests that under mixed control of sex allocation, a stable equilibrium should be reached for a definite value of the sex ratio (controlled by the queen) and a definite value of the proportion of females raised as workers (controlled by workers). The sex allocation ratio should stabilize at some point between the queen's and the workers' optima, and all colonies are expected to converge toward the ESS values. A major constraint of the Reuter-Keller model is that in their mixed control case, the adult sex ratio (workers ϩ gynes vs. males) remains under full queen control. Despite the fact that elimination of male brood is a common feature of ant colonies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aron et al. 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aron et al. , 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aron et al. , 1999;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Keller et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Sundstro ¨m et al. 1996)</ref>, workers are not allowed to eliminate males: they can influence sex allocation (gynes vs. males) solely by modifying the proportion of diploid eggs raised as gynes rather than as workers. Another restriction of the Reuter-Keller model is that the genetic payoffs are calculated according to the relative quantities of each caste or sex raised, thereby severely restraining potential effects of absolute differences in productivity between colonies. In our model, such differences are essential.</p><p>Our model suggests that split sex ratios in ants could fundamentally result from queens adopting a mixed ESS <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Maynard Smith 1982)</ref>. At the population equilibrium, queens are faced with a choice between two alternatives yielding an equal genetic payoff. If the population stands away from the equilibrium, the payoffs become unequal. Since individual queens are unlikely to be able to detect which option is better, they must "play the field." The return to the equilibrium will be driven by frequencydependent selection. These conditions are characteristic of a mixed ESS <ref type="bibr">(Maynard Smith 1982, p. 69)</ref>. A remarkable feature of a mixed ESS is that it can be reached through several processes. The decision of being either a male producer or a gyne producer can be everything from purely genetic to purely environmental, provided that the probability of expressing either phenotype is constant. The possibility of shifting from one strategy to the other is also theoretically open. In Solenopsis invicta, further research should determine whether the switch is under genetic control or not, and if not, whether any environmental cue influences the queen's choice and whether she can shift strategies at some point of her life or not. Among colonies of S. invicta monitored over 1 yr, a minority were found to shift their sex allocation during the observation period, but whether such shifts occurred with or without queen replacement is not known <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Markin and Dillier 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Morrill 1974)</ref>. Long-term studies on this topic are badly needed.</p><p>Our model predicts that male-producing colonies should realize a lower investment in sexuals than gyneproducing ones. Such a pattern is commonplace in ants <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Nonacs 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Crozier and Pamilo 1996)</ref>. To explain this, several authors have put forward hypotheses based on resource abundance, assuming that an increased amount of resources could more easily (e.g., by switching the development of diploid larvae toward the gyne caste) or more profitably (e.g., if gynes benefit more than males from an increased amount of body reserves, or if males engage in local mate competition) be invested into gynes than into males <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Nonacs 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Frank 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rosenheim et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chapuisat and Keller 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Aron et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ode and Rissing 2002)</ref>. However, these hypotheses do not fit well with extremely biased sex ratios. Our model suggests that male specialization does not necessarily follow from lower productivity but that both characteristics may be consequences of diploid egg limitation by the queen. The model also predicts that female-biased sex allocation at the population level results from male-specialized colonies being less productive, but not less abundant, than gyne-specialized ones. In monogynous populations of S. invicta, available data suggest that this is actually the case <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Morrill 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Vargo 1996)</ref>, although sampling biases and high variance in sexual productivity between colonies make it problematic to obtain fully reliable, statistically significant results. An indirect way to solve this problem could be through the comparison of worker populations between male-and gyne-producing colonies: our model indeed predicts that differences in worker force should be more pronounced than differences in colony productivity, because the productivity per worker should be higher in the less populous male-producing colonies. For instance, in the simulation presented above, the worker force ratio between gyne-producing and male-producing colonies reaches 5.5 : 1, whereas the sexual productivity ratio is only 2.2 : 1.</p><p>At this point, formulating quantitative predictions still remains very hazardous. The numerical simulation had no other aim than illustrating the qualitative results of the analytical model. Even for a well-studied species such as S. invicta, only crude estimates of life-history parameters are available, and environmental effects, which are necessarily complex, are extremely difficult to incorporate into the model. For this reason, a close fit could not be expected between the numerical results of our model and the actual data recorded for S. invicta. For instance, the model predicts a proportional investment in gynes of 0.69 in S. invicta, which is substantially higher than the mean value of 0.607 provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Vargo (1996)</ref>, although the confidence interval on this mean is not known. Further sampling is needed to determine whether the high ratio between the worker force of gyne-producing versus male-producing colonies (5.5 : 1) predicted by the simulation is realistic or not. In any case, the qualitative predictions that emerged as to the relative size, abundance, and productivity of male-and gyne-producing colonies within a population are testable. Across populations or species, our model predicts a positive relationship between female bias at equilibrium and female caste dimorphism (gynes vs. workers), but this prediction is harder to test because many other factors may concurrently influence population-wide sex allocation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bourke and Franks 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Crozier and Pamilo 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chapuisat and Keller 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Hypotheses based on relatedness asymmetries have thus far been very successful in explaining some but not all cases of split sex ratios in social Hymenoptera (review in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Queller and Strassmann 1998)</ref>. The model developed here discloses another possible pathway for the evolution of this phenomenon. The possibility of strongly bimodal sex ratios resulting from the adoption of a mixed ESS by the queens under very simple assumptions is a major result of this study. In view of this hypothesis, it would be of utmost interest to study the mechanisms underlying the queen's choice in monogyne S. invicta or in other species, wherever the primary sex ratio imposed by the queen determines the colony's sex allocation. Further theoretical developments of this model are also needed. We are now attempting, on the one hand, to include a limited life expectancy of the colonies and, on the other hand, to deal with bimodal sex ratios in more complicated genetic structures, such as the facultative oligogyny displayed by some ant species <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Fournier et al. 2003)</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>this point, the left-hand side of this equation should be positive: .
